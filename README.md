# 💻 Cafe Management System (OOP Concepts)

The **Cyber Cafe Management System** is a console-based application developed in **C++** that simulates real-world operations of a cyber cafe. It uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction to efficiently manage users, time tracking, and billing.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Designed and implemented a menu-driven system for managing a cyber cafe  
- Allows user registration, session tracking, and billing calculations
- Focuses on modular and maintainable code through core OOP principles  
- Provides an interactive CLI-based interface for both admins and users

## 🧠 Key Functionalities

- Register new users and assign systems  
- Track login and logout times  
- Calculate session duration and generate charges 
- Admin access to manage activities

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **C++** – Core programming language  
- **OOP Concepts** – Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.  
- **File Handling** – For storing logs and reports  
- **Standard Library (STL)** – For dynamic data management  

## 💡 Use Cases

- Simulated management system for educational purposes  
- Practice project for applying C++ OOP concepts  
- Useful foundation for GUI-based or full-stack expansion  

## 🛠️ OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- **Encapsulation** – Secure data within objects  
- **Inheritance** – Base and derived class relationships (e.g., User and Admin)  
- **Polymorphism** – Function overloading or runtime method calls  
- **Abstraction** – Clean interface design for managing user operations

- C++ OOP tutorials and references  
- Inspiration from real cyber cafe operations
